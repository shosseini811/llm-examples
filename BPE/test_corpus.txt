Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing by introducing self-attention mechanisms that can capture long-range dependencies in text.

The GPT-4 model demonstrates remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text across a wide variety of domains and tasks.

Tokenization is a critical preprocessing step for all language models. It converts raw text into sequences of tokens that can be processed by neural networks.

Out-of-vocabulary words present a significant challenge for traditional word-level tokenization approaches. Words like "untransformable" or "hyperparametrization" might not appear in the training data.

BPE handles rare words effectively by breaking them into subword units. For example, "untransformable" can be broken into "un" + "transform" + "able".

Multilingual models benefit greatly from subword tokenization, as it allows them to share vocabulary across languages with similar morphological patterns.

The efficiency of tokenization algorithms impacts both training and inference speed of language models. BPE offers a good balance between vocabulary size and sequence length.

Researchers continue to develop improved tokenization methods, such as Unigram, WordPiece, and SentencePiece, each with their own advantages for specific use cases.
