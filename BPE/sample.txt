Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) is a data compression technique that iteratively replaces the most frequent pair of consecutive bytes in a sequence with a single, unused byte. This algorithm has been adapted for use in natural language processing as a subword tokenization method.

In the context of language models, BPE starts with a vocabulary of individual characters and iteratively merges the most frequent adjacent character pairs to form new tokens. This process continues until a desired vocabulary size is reached.

BPE offers several advantages for language models:
1. It creates a fixed-size vocabulary, which is computationally efficient.
2. It handles rare words by breaking them into subword units.
3. It can represent any word, even those not seen during training.
4. It finds a good balance between character-level and word-level tokenization.

For example, the word "untransformable" might be tokenized as "un" + "transform" + "able", allowing the model to understand its meaning even if the full word was never seen during training.

BPE is widely used in modern language models like GPT, BERT, and their derivatives, helping these models achieve impressive performance across various natural language processing tasks.
